---Query 2: This querys the complete database for the fields which are identified by the Verb SELECT, then Partitions the whole output by the TXN_ID , 
---inside each TXN_ID, this sorts the records by TDATE 
---If you look at the TXN_D , you will note all transactions are grouped by the same TXN_ID
----All transactions are sorted with in the TXN_ID grouping descending order of time 
----See the above Query1 and figure out waht is happening , especially see the last colum rn

---Query 3: See Query 2 and now see Query 3, there is only two changes 
----- The Query 2 generates a table with a new column identified as rn 
------This whole table is now used to query so the from section of our new query now becomes the table that was generated in Query 2

---Query 4: We will add one condition to query 3, just see the change 
-----The condition we will add is WHERE rn=1
----Just look at the rn column
----Think why are we doing it

---Query 6 : Till Now we have been looking at transactions covering all dates 
---Now we will look at only transactions if yesetday

----Query 7: What I am actually interested in 
--- Every transaction has a response code=RC. 
--- We are interested only in Unsucesfull transactions ==> Status != 'C' ## that is Status is not C
--- Wether its a TD or BD will depend on the type of RC we get , hence we are getting the RCs for 
        ---Display_Message
        ---RC
        ---CBS_RC
        ---PSO_RC
        ---DTSP_RC
        ---DIRECTION <ONUS / OffUS>
        ---PAYER_RC
        ---PAYEE_RC
        ---UPI_CLIENT_TXN
----These are basically response codes 
--- And these must be an unique list, ideally 
---Hence lests first get the unique itesm for each of these 

----Query 8: Please run the following querries one by one 
----Keep the output in a sheet , name the sheet properly , keep all sheets in the same excel \
